Wrapper for the jQuery-Week-Calendar Javascrip library.

Just add to your gemfile:

 gem 'jquery-week-calendar'

And include in your application.js:

 //= require jquery-week-calendar
 
Optionall include in your application.css

 *= require jquery-week-calendar

You'll probably want to also use jquery-ui with it for a quick skin. For this I used the 'jquery-ui-themes' gem to get setup, but you can also use the Google hosted version of course.
